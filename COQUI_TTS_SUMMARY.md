# üé§ Upgrading Ani to Natural Voice with Coqui TTS

## Quick Summary

I've added **Coqui TTS** support to Ani so she can have a beautiful, natural-sounding anime voice instead of the robotic Microsoft Edge TTS!

## ‚ú® What's New

### **Before (Edge TTS):**
- ‚ùå Robotic, synthetic sounding
- ‚ùå Generic Microsoft voice
- ‚ùå Requires internet connection
- ‚ùå No voice customization

### **After (Coqui TTS):**
- ‚úÖ Natural, human-like voice
- ‚úÖ Can clone any anime character voice!
- ‚úÖ Works 100% offline on your GPU
- ‚úÖ Fully customizable

## üöÄ How to Install

### **Option 1: Easy Installation (Recommended)**

Just double-click: **`install_coqui.bat`**

This will:
1. Install Coqui TTS
2. Create the voice_samples folder
3. Test the installation

### **Option 2: Manual Installation**

Open PowerShell and run:
```powershell
python -m pip install TTS
```

## üéØ How to Enable

### **Step 1: Open main_full.py**

Find line 103 (around there):
```python
tts_config = TTSConfig(engine="edge", voice="en-US-AriaNeural")
```

### **Step 2: Change to Coqui TTS**

**For default natural voice:**
```python
tts_config = TTSConfig(
    engine="coqui",
    voice="tts_models/multilingual/multi-dataset/xtts_v2"
)
```

**For anime voice cloning (if you have a sample):**
```python
tts_config = TTSConfig(
    engine="coqui",
    voice="tts_models/multilingual/multi-dataset/xtts_v2",
    speaker_wav="voice_samples/ani_voice.wav"
)
```

### **Step 3: Restart Ani**

```powershell
python main_full.py
```

Look for:
```
[OK] Coqui TTS initialized on cuda
```

## üé≠ Voice Cloning Guide

Want Ani to sound like your favorite anime character?

### **Step 1: Get a Voice Sample**

Find a 3-6 second audio clip of the character:
- Clear voice with minimal background noise
- Just one person speaking
- WAV or MP3 format
- Example: Extract from anime episode, game voice lines, etc.

### **Step 2: Save the Sample**

1. Create folder: `F:\Ani\voice_samples\`
2. Save your audio as: `ani_voice.wav`

### **Step 3: Update Config**

In main_full.py:
```python
tts_config = TTSConfig(
    engine="coqui",
    voice="tts_models/multilingual/multi-dataset/xtts_v2",
    speaker_wav="voice_samples/ani_voice.wav"  # Your anime voice!
)
```

### **Step 4: Test It!**

Restart Ani and talk to her - she'll use the cloned voice!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Performance

| Metric | Edge TTS | Coqui TTS |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **First Generation** | ~500ms | ~3-5s (model loading) |
| **Subsequent** | ~500ms | ~1-2s |
| **Quality** | 6/10 | 9/10 |
| **GPU Usage** | 0% | ~30% |
| **VRAM** | 0 MB | ~2 GB |
| **Internet** | Required | Not required |

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "No module named 'TTS'"
```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install TTS
```

### "CUDA out of memory"
Close other GPU applications or use Edge TTS instead.

### Voice doesn't sound right
- Try a different voice sample (3-6 seconds)
- Make sure the sample is clear and high quality
- Check the file path in the config

### Very slow generation
- First generation is always slow (~5s) as the model loads
- After that it should be 1-2 seconds
- Make sure you're using CUDA (check logs)

## üí° Tips

- **Best results**: Use clear 3-6 second anime voice samples
- **Language support**: English, Japanese, Chinese, Korean + 12 more
- **Multiple voices**: Create multiple samples in voice_samples/
