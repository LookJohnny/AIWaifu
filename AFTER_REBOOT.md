python main_full.py
```

Look for: `[OK] Ollama backend initialized (llama3.1:8b)`

## 💡 Quick Reminder

**What Ani does:**
1. You speak → Microphone
2. Speech → Text (Whisper)
3. Text → AI thinks (Llama 3.1 on your RTX 4060)
4. AI response → Voice (Edge TTS)
5. Voice plays back to you

**Total time:** ~1-2 seconds per conversation!

---

## 🎓 To Show Me Progress

When you come back, just say:
> "I rebooted, Ollama is installed, what's next?"

Or:
> "After reboot, where do I start?"

I'll know exactly where you are!
